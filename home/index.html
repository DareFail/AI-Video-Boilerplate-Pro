                    <p>HandLand comes with three complete two-player games:</p>
    
                    <ol>
                    <li>Rock, Paper, Scissors</li>
                    <li>Staring Contest</li>
                    <li>007 (Standoff or Block, Reload, Shoot, and Shotgun) - <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Shotgun-Game">How to play</a></li>
                    </ol>

            <div class="textContainer">
                <div>The files are very short so you can mess around with them and make new games or just learn how websockets work. It has the most basic matchmaking possible as well as shareable links - whoever has the same link as you will be in your "room". </div>
                <div>The tech is very simple, it's a very minimal Express JS server with 3 folders of 3 multiplayer games. The games use WebRTC and native Websockets to connect in real time. AI Vision models were made and provided by <a href="(https://roboflow.com/)">Roboflow</a>. They are sponsoring this project and you can use a free API key to train your own model and make games.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="textContainer">
                I trained one of the models myself by taking a video of myself and annotating ~200 hundred frames for object detection.

            <div class="textContainer">
                This process sounds harder than it is. You upload a video and just drag boxes around you hands and write the game move you want to recognize. It may take trial and error with similar hand motions.
